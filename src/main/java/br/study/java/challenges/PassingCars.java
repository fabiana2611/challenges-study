 * 
 * A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given. The consecutive elements 
 * of array A represent consecutive cars on a road.
 * 
 * Array A contains only 0s and/or 1s:
 * 0 represents a car traveling east,
 * 1 represents a car traveling west.
 * 
 * The goal is to count passing cars. We say that a pair of cars (P, Q), 
 * where 0 â‰¤ P < Q < N, is passing when P is traveling to the east and Q is traveling to the west.
